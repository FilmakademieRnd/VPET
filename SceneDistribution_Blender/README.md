# VPET for Blender

VPET addon for Blender 2.81 and higher.

## Description

VPET allows for real-time manipulation and scene editing through one or multiple mobile clients.

This addon allows using Blender as a host application.

Note: This addon is still in early development.

## Installation

Download the zip file from the [Addon](/Addon) folder.

In Blender go to Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install... and navigate to the downloaded zip file. Once you enabled the Addon it will show up on the right side of your 3D viewport.

## Usage

For a quick introduction, please refer to our [quick-start guide](../.doc/VPET_Blender_Quickstart.md)

## Supported Blender Versions

For now this Addon only supports Blender 2.81 and up.

## Additional Tools

For syncronization between clients (tablets, phones...) and host (Blender), the side tool **SyncServer** is needed.

Refer back to the repository root for more information.

## Dependencies

The current release needs **pyzmq** to work. The Addon has a function to install this via pip. Please refer to our [quick-start guide](../.doc/VPET_Blender_Quickstart.md) for more information.

You could also install **pyzmq** manually but please be aware that (under windows) it needs to be in this location to work:

**c:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender x.xx\x.xx\python\lib\site-packages**

## Network Requirements

The host computer (running Blender) and the client devices must be connected to the same network and be able to reach each other.

Communication happens via Ã˜MQ (ZeroMQ) over ports **5556** and **5565**.
