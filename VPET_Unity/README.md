This project contains all that is needed for using Unity Engine as a host application.

Included is also the client application.

## Content

This Unity project has two core scenes under `VPET\Scenes`, offered as a starting point depending on your demands:

- `VPET_Server` - a scene ready for being distributed over the network and synchronized with mobile VPET clients.

- `VPET_Client` - scene for building the VPET client, useful for custom modification


## Additional tools

For synchronization between clients (tablets, phones...) and host (Unity Engine),
the side tool **SyncServer** is needed.
